gerberlover2019,Sorry but if he’s willing 2 vote for 45 over Sanders or Warren his morals are pretty out of whack. Might be worth considering that it’s easy to say he’d vote 4 Hickenlooper bcuz he knows he’ll never have to. The Loop is not getting the nom. It’s an easy way to sound “moderate.”
WideLightImages,Then I guess I don't understand your point.  Yes he murmurs some Bernie Sanders talking points in the middle of the thing but it's essentially just the same blah blah that racial supremacists have always been saying.  Him saying 'I'm not a white supremacist' doesn't change that.

AllBataar,Why should you be nervous. You are such a good person. You are great at what you do and way better than anyone I know at making people smile. You brighten up my day with your funny videos and the Sanders sides help me with problems I have. Thank you Thomas thank you.   ~Sam.

bevo1232,I was watching @MSNBC earlier today when the host rudely cut off @AndrewYang while he was talking just to go to Bernie Sanders. I really wanted to hear what Andrew had to say... 
kaigogiburdens,Did you blame Bernie Sanders when Rep. Steve Scalise was shot by a Sanders volunteer?
Logically_Sound,He took a quiet breath gently rubbing Virgil's back.
littleblondie35,Hey Uncle Sanders you stop your hateful name-calling mouth. Your language is the one that emboldens violent extremists. the shooter was a liberal! A liberal! All you Democrats know how to do is throw out your hateful vile names at anyone that you disagree with. You're using...

Searcher1911,Wait a minute Sanders; the shooter in Texas wanted Free Healthcare and universal Income.  You preach that nonsense not Pres Trump.  The guy was a Progressive like YOU.
PoBoyReeves,I grew up poor but never paycheck to paycheck.  I understood how to budget.  Something congress does not seam to grasp. How long have you been in Congress Mr Sanders? I would say Congress keeps the entire country living from paycheck to paycheck.
MeatballSander,Biggest compliment I've ever received
Tav_assoli,Still winning even a simple senate majority isn’t high probability and a supermajority is definitely a longshot. Sanders endorsed direct civil action as necessary for sweeping change more than once during the campaign and I have to agree.
riotwomennn,Hope people so their homework.  Sanders has a horrible voting record & rhetoric on gun safety.  In 2018 he tried to flip his position but at 5 years older than Trump his old way of thinking & sympathy for the aggrieved white man seems to slip out.    btw the NRA grading is bogus pic.twitter.com/KsnYg92Nw4

AnxiousBoiVirge,Virgil growled "THERE IS NOTHING WRONG!" he barked at her clenching his fist.

ClayJParker,Right from the Democrat's handbook. Call him a racist and blame him for the world's problems. Let me ask you this Mr Sanders You have been in DC since 2007 that's 9 years longer than President Trump what have YOU done to solve the problems he inherited yet you blame him for?

UrHrtingMyBrain,A win for Democrats could be so easy.  Just get out of Bernie Sanders way.  Have your Centrist propagandist MSM take their thumbs off the scale and Dems win in the General.  Every top tier candidate has adopted some form of Bernie's platform. The path to victory is clear.

Bowiegrrl1,Also Sanders was never put in jail. He was ticketed in college and fined $25. That’s it. That’s his while Civil Rights record since 1963. The end.
Shannan_W_Clark,Yeah because taking a pot shot at Sanders is somehow an effective way of fighting the white nationalism and fascism that fuels our recent terrorist massacres.  #Bernie2020 is condemning mass shootings and calling them #meshugganah

NYforSanders,Joe Biden is a great candidate if you want a record low number of young people to vote.

dontdoxmeh,I know you’re not disagreeing. I just vividly remember the primary and constantly being called a sexist specifically by a friend who I really respected and who no longer even speaks to me all because I felt Sanders was a better choice to HRC. The Democratic Party was so toxic.

LynnoVen,Stein & Sanders did the Russians work for them. If you live in a swing state &  care about the country you don’t vote third party. People who did that in Fla in 2000 gave us Bush and the Iraq war. People who did it in 2016 helped elect Trump and put Kavanaugh/Gorsuch on SCOTUS.

robertberens,Liberal sees (partial) clip from a shit-stirring anti-BS outlet of BS speaking apply least charitable read of his words. BS supporters flood the replies protesting the (arguable) mischaracterization. Anti-Sanders liberals flood to defend original assertion. Twitter melee ensues.
SirJacobDale,Yea. It's sad that too many people would.
JayJay5077,The only way progressives candidates like Pete/Sanders or Warren can win or be very competitive is that they need to go for 3 for 3 win in IA/NH/NV meaning they have to knock out Kamala and Biden early to prevent a embarrassment loss SC the south and CA with JB or KH is around

RoseAli08474193,Bernie Sanders don't turn the shooting in America into your campaign propoganda
Mekons,@MarcosBreton have you seen the entire video? Sanders ends his statement with “The American people are overwhelmingly united. And that is gun owners and non-gun owners in wanting to see the passage of common sense gun safety legislation. Where’s the dodge?”

amfhTX,I see you have unfollowed me. Sorry to see you go. (no that is NOT snark). We all have reasons to support or not support candidates.  This issue is one why I don't support Warren.  Another is that she agreed w/Sanders that DNC "fixed" things for HRC.  #NeverBernie nor his buds.
Jotilpip,
spandexlurch,Awesome argument against emotional based gun control. I like you momentarily again.
brolensky,I want Beto O’Rourke to be president. I would also support Biden Sanders Warren Harris Booker Yang Klobuchar with enthusiasm if it comes to that. Buttigieg and Castro can go suck a lemon. I don’t like them. I don’t want them leading us. Just no. Williamson and Gabbard-NO
HopefulSanders,I was trying to put a dress in your room! Not snoop!  You better find it. I’ll fucking use all your shirts as new fabric if you don’t. I have this entire list of annoying things I can do.

tankfreepoker,Baltimore's mayor said the city was infested.  She was black.  Bernie Sanders said Baltimore was worse than a 3rd world country.   He has condemned White Supremacy about 12 times a day.  The MSM and the Democrat party using race baiting for power caused this.

JollyJellyBean_,The reason I can't name a new law is because one hasn't been made yet. The bill Sanders is trying to put through could prevent some shootings because of tighter gun regulations - keyword SOME. I know a new law could not stop them all but a reduction of deaths is still good.
Phobia_Sanders,... SHUTUPIENJOYIT-
ShamanPolitical,Sanders knows better he fought against real supremacy in college. It's why his voters are delusional to think the Clinton machine didnt get to him in 2016 and why one of his supporters gunned down Republicans at a ballgame.
graverobberJC,Overgeneralizing. I am a strong supporter of the Progressive policies mostly fronted by Bernie Sanders. Liberal Jewish is not anti-Zionist. The two are not correlated.

KTKeith,You’re trying to guilt people into voting for Sanders because his supporters refuse to vote for anyone else when he loses. We have to vote for Sanders or it will lead to Trump but they don’t have to vote for anyone else knowing it will lead to Trump? It’s obvious who’s the child.
elliemaygottasa,this is an outrage.  Dems will do and say anything for power.  Bernie Sanders going on TV saying this about our President is terrifying.

CrystalJackLack,They're gonna put the White House in a prison? I think president Kamala is way more likely than them paying for that. But I'll be just as happy to do it under president Sanders or Warren or Biden or really a wide variety of administrations will do.
SIMPLECommonSe2,Actually much of his reasoning aligns with Yangs rhetoric and Sanders rhetoric. Are they responsible also? No. None of them are. Because this attack isn't a white supremacy attack. It's a new breed of attack: the troll shitpost. Doing it just to stir up political unrest.

rainbow_jeremy_,The race where polls were actually terrible was the Dem Primary where Sanders regularly outperformed by 10 20 even 60+% (eg MN caucus poll had Clinton +34 Sanders won by 23)  Except the South where Clinton consistently beat polls by 10-20 points..

Heath_C_Walker,I've NEVER heard Sen. Sanders mischaracterize or overplay the role of mental illness in our Mass Shootings debate. It does play a small part in our problem & must be addressed if every life matters. We cant let the GOP blame the entire problem on it but we cant ignore it either.
RyanAFournier,I don’t recall anti-Bernie Sanders rhetoric when one of his supporters opened fire on members of Congress practicing for a baseball game in 2017.  There’s only one person to blame.   The shooter.

CreamerDaCrop,If you want to blame Trump for an extreme follower blame him I’ll be cool with it as long as you keep that same energy with Bernie Sanders for the guy that took the “fight back every way possible” message to the baseball fields in Alexandria.

TGoldstein8,Sanders will say anything to stay in the news. What he is really mad about is not being related to the Colonal and reaping in those royaties.
TimCWrites,Sanders has been championing some issues for SO long that aspects of them are now effectively resolved (like ozone depletion). The qualities that Bernie in 86 has which seems to have departed Bernie of 2019 in the intervening years are curiousity and self-doubt.

djinn_the,I would say this about Sanders but not Warren. She sounds like any other neoliberal hawk on foreign policy. Her statements on Israel are disqualifying.   I believe Sanders is more likely to name-names and she is more used to promoting institutional culture.

friendly_gravy,Sanders was the first (and perhaps only haven't re-checked) to call the shooter a racist when tweeting about El Paso. And unlike Warren he's also used that label on Trump. It's refreshing but very rare in the Dem field which is puzzling - pretty weak of the others.

spwcpa,If #Democrats want to get the votes of #Independents they need to not move so far to the left.  I would love to not vote for Trump but #Warren and #Sanders are far too left for me.  I am sure many Independents have this same view.  Help Americans have a realistic option.

BarkinDavid,The Biggest supporters of "Dem Exit" is the DNC itself. The one thing that terrorizes them is the idea of the Democratic Party returning to the New Deal.   DON'T PLAY INTO THEIR HANDS!  As Beth says register to vote as a Democrat and we get Bernie Sanders as our President!

fynnkaterin,Sanders is conflating gun violence with mental illness which stigmatizes mental illness and distracts from the real issue which is guns. That's what we're criticizing here and it's a fair criticism.
larryh88401,These demotards liberals sanders blame all on the gun. The gun has to be loaded the gun has to be aimed and the trigger  has to be pressed. No demotard blames people for the shooting. We let them touch our guns we are in trouble

broncoshottakes,How do you cover Sutton and Sanders on the outside Hamilton and Riddick in the slot and Lindsay out of the backfield?  I don't know if you do. #BroncosCamp
DiegoAmarosa,Exact same bullshit Sarah Fuckabee Sanders said the day after Vegas massacre.
TheTaoOfPooh2,Very civil. And you hear very little racial slurs (there are always a few). But if you try to take away these people’s guns ‘over my dead body’ will become quite literal. They are not giving them up.
SirJacobDale,I am ashamed to admit it because I live there. I want to prevent terrorist attacks never cause them. I just feel conflicted about the war we have going on.

BeerHolder95,That rhetoric is normal for CNN and other leftist Democrats. They wont be happy until another Sanders supporter (like James Hodgkinson) snaps and tries to kill those they simply disagree with.
Truth_OverT,The Republican party is a disgraceful sick organization. Modern day evil. The Democrats are complicit cowards enablers that allow the red team to get away with their sociopathic behavior.  This country needs a Bernie Sanders presidency so badly. We need someone with a soul.

JimWelker2,Bernie Sanders with his rhetoric is one of the major perpetrators of the anger and frustration built on democrat lies that cause much of this violence.
Dekejlp,The people advocating for socialism fail to understand that government must take from some in order to give it to someone else. Sanders Harris and Warren would confiscate businesses and have the government control every aspect of production similar to the Soviet Union.
CharlesVarns,Wait a second here.  A Bernie Sanders supporter tried to assassinate as many Republican congress people as he could  ... and you don't see this as a problem?    Another Sanders'   supporter attacked Rand Paul and broke his ribs.  Take a look in the mirror already ... geez!
Malinowski_L,Why El Paso? Why Walnart? The Shooter traveled a long way to El Paso which is Beto O’Rourke’s City. Walmart has become the face of Sanders $15 minimum wage campaign. Beto & Castro have plenty of their own rhetoric. The Shooter was captured “White Privilege”?
SandersGary20,I understand your skepticism as a lot of us but promise you winds are changing! Don’t get hocked up on the 1 on 100 list teams with success have more players there of course (unless your Calvin) and there namnes live on even though a down year. Big difference already next year!

fynnkaterin,Frankly as someone who originally supported him against Clinton and eventually became utterly unable to based entirely on *the actual words he said* and NOT on anyone else's commentary maybe the reason Bernie Sanders gets so much criticism is that he's so wrong all the time.
zuhbeer,the free Bernie shit is funny but inaccurate. inform yourself on his healthcare and education policies before dismissing him w jokes. The last time the U.S. had a reformer like Bernie as president we elected him FOUR times. Check out the similarities btwn FDR and Sanders

donavon_ebooks,She’s all i have left. Bernie sanders needs to fix his posture before it’s too late.
MarkJTompkins,Agreed...but Sanders has ALSO called for an assault weapons ban and for the Senate to vote on the House-passed gun control bills. He's not ignoring the elephant in the room he's just saying that mental health needs focus as well.
shielapul,Yeah and you aren’t willing to help prevent these massacres w common sense legislation while trying to take away healthcare from those who get shot from your unwillingness to do anything to prevent it.  So just stfu. #DaytonShooting

aspirational_no,By retweeting a cherry-picked video and incorrectly  attributing that sentiment to one candidate when it is sadly ticket-wide he is exactly in fact pretending it's only Sanders' problem.  I will retract this when he gets equally mad at the other candidates about it.

MitchGayns,It's not like I hate these other plans but literally every single one of those is either aided or outright enabled by sanders vision. If you got a problem with him playing only one note maybe it's worth realizing it's because that is the one that helps everyone else get in tune

3d_w0rd,Your characterization of Warren as " a faculty-club know-it-all scold " sounds like something Ben Shapiro would say. I agree that Warren and Sander's Medicare plan is quite far to the left but this characterization isn't about policy but rather on a prejudiced standpoint.
ShawnTheDon8,Deion Sanders was a great punt returner as well so people will use that to say he was better because people live off nostalgia.

FlakedAndFormed,Wrong. And your cherry-picking disqualifies you from participating in any rational discourse on Sanders.
FloridaTopAgent,We kick prayer out of schools and kick kids out of schools for praying but we ask them to pray after a tragedy happens.  This is the real tragedy.
ShawnTheDon8,I will die on that Hill & say Champ Bailey was a better overall cornerback than Deion Sanders. Their coverage skills were about equal speed was equal but Champ was a way better tackler than Deion ever was. The only thing Deion was better than Champ in was being flashy.

SanderDaviesC,Except it's simple: as a progressive Bernie has the best chance. If you're a progressive it's absurd to think that Tulsi or Yang have a better shot when it's literally impossible for them to win.

ToxicMask1,Bernie Sanders & Beto O'Rourke are playing a dangerous game.  Accusing people of being white supremacists isn't much different than using racial slurs.  It's not a light accusation it's a very serious accusation with very serious consequences.  It encourages violence unjustly.

camp_bean,Sanders is an out-and-out red communist. What a junk graph.
BoiStarbucks,He grinned. "Neat!" he sighed resting his head on his hand "I could never do anything like what you are... I'm so so proud of you.. I hope you know that..."
april_harding,Agree. And Kronmen didn’t mention that even tho Sanders’ data on mismatch in law schools is particularly persuasive. In general I wish more people were aware of the mismatch research findings. But the surveillance & punishment system strongly discourages such discourse.

jholtham,It's the millions of Americans right now saying to themselves and each other Well they did kind of have it coming didn't they? It's the people who vote for GOP politicians. It's the people Sanders is even afraid of pissing off by calling out "gun culture."
Xzamilloh,No you just chose to miss the point entirely. We can point to Ben Shapiro's words and rhetoric being the inspiration for more than one mass shooter. And yet the ONE example you have a Bernie Sanders supporter was a one off that you CAN'T point to any Bernie Sanders rhetoric
TheTaoOfPooh2,Fuck the typos too.
JasonRussell1,Sanders supporters are awfully sensitive on guns since ya know it helped to cost him the primary in 2016 and is still a very weak spot in his record. He supports only doing the minimum on background checks and high magazine assault rifles with no licensing bullet tracing etc

ccbpeters,Do they not recognize they stoke hate?   They started the night Trump was elected and look for every opportunity to keep it going.   Bernie Sanders is an angry old socialist living in the wrong country - to begin with. He can’t possibly be positive about anything in America.
kaileebsanders,Yeah no it’s white supremacy you need to learn what’s going on.
verdetingo,Sanders is done he will say whatever comes to his socialist brain to get attention  
sharsand123,You are so right.  At this point if we took all the guns away these white nationalists would get what they needed somewhere.  I believe  taxpayers r paying for Trump's shameful rallies where he agitates nothing but hate.  Where's the outcry.

Lollardfish,2) On the left then many politicians - right now I'm pissed at Bernie Sanders but Obama did this too - say "no it's the guns AND mental illness so we should control guns and GIVE NICE HEALTH CARE to people with mental illness."  They accept that the two are linked.

redzupp,Right; it says to me that their top two options were not on the ballot they chose Trump because he was less unpopular (uncharted politically) than Clinton. I support Sanders but he's not plugged in to the self-preserving Dem surrogate army & that continues to work against him.
PappyPattonDogs,Awful? Like what? Don't be sad... I'm here for you!

GayderVincent,Btw Bernie Sanders had for decades fought for gun control and to outlaw assault rifles. In a democracy a single senator has little voice in the Senate and no power. He cares and wants progress but he is powerless to do anything. The majority of senate wants guns and violence.

eulerscosta,NRA hates him. Sanders ran afoul of the organization in 94 when he voted for a bill that would ban 19 varieties of semiautomatic assault weapons. According to Feldman a former NRA lobbyist voting in favor of banning any kind of firearm is in the eyes of the NRA unredeemable.
Joe38838200,Alot more communist politicians in office especially Bernie Sanders.

FeralHog420,Let me know when Sanders has ever called Republican Congresmen invaders rapists crime-infested coming from sh*thole countries etc.  He never said that? Right. So this is a false equivalence. Your desultory use of logic is probably part of why you’re a “former” politician. 
TrinityMustache,DSA-types often have a way of deflecting from talking about regulating guns bully trying to refocus on mental health just like the GOP and Bernie Sanders. But that’s a disingenuous diversion for a couple of reasons. 1st most mass shooters do not have the types of mental health
OpinionMinister,They have in common neo communist Bernie Sanders' #America  hating and divisive rhetoric.
DreamSong77,Just saw Jackie Mason walk into a old school kosher deli on the upper west side. Achievement unlocked.

HighPointsUSA,You have no idea what you are talking about. Socialism and Communism is what Sanders and others are promoting. Trump is completely against those “isms.” He supports what the Founding Fathers creates...free market and liberty.
StallJoeIngs,Applying an arbitrary amount of X anywhere and for any job is the fundamental problem of Sander's and other socialists position.  Again this is their goal:  Elimination of free market everything and gov't control of everything.  Disguised as worker advocacy of course.

SKlingendaal1,De “radicaliteit” rond het #boerkaverbod zit  ‘m uitsluitend in dat burgerarrest van 53 Sv. Het “midden” bestaat al: nl. dat het arrest moet voldoen aan subsidiariteit en proportionaliteit en dus kansloos lijkt. Maar nu de niqaab.. er is net als bij antifascisme geen midden!

MistyNight6,It's pretty obvious how to tell if a Sanders Warren Booker etc supporter is racist. Def don't need an explanation
jon2bad,I appreciate that Sanders is coming around somewhat on gun control https://twitter.com/BernieSanders/status/1158037589112381442 …
MellerNathan,She has my support because she has stated policies with plans and the ability to work under pressure but I'm http://still.open  minded The new Bernie? How Warren is quietly converting Sanders backers https://wapo.st/2KdesTK 
AnxiousBoiVirge,"No i want to. It's too hot in the house anyway" he shrugged "you should take a picture if you're staring it lasts longer" he winked.

k_2752ks,How could any of us have friended them? Their page is pretty clearly MAGA.
fightofpc,Does Bernie Sanders bear responsibility for the shooter that he inspired? No. Shootings happened long before the trump admin took office. Shooting because common under the Obama admin. Does it make shootings Obama’s vault? No.

JinaeSBarbary,Count your blessings
_JohnB21,Again Sanders is clearly an ally on this issue & trying to ostracize him while there’s clearly a national crisis on guns going on is fucking strange at best and counterintuitive at it’s core.

rising_serpent,Justice Democrats was formed when Young Turks' Cenk Uygur banded with former Bernie Sanders 2016 campaign members including Saikat Chakrabarti. Therefore like all socialist ventures this one too was founded to enrich its leaders while feasting on the penury of its adherents.

vpi75wood,Sander's blaming Trump for racist rhetoric on @JakeTapper show. How many words come out of Trump's mouth each day versus out of CNN's or Fox News' or MSNBC's mouths?  Then tell me who is pushing racism in this nation.
AdorabLDeplrabL,Bernie Sanders is s racist.   How many black people has he helped?   None...Bernie Sanders is not black.   How many Latino people has Bernie helped?   None...Bernie Sanders is not Latino.  Bernie Sanders only helps old white men....because he has only ever helped himself.

TruthMatters333,This is Bernie Sanders response to unprecedented # of mass shootings happening in America the only country this happens in and one can only gather from Sander's response is the question being why are so many American White guys so stark raving INSANE? https://twitter.com/thehill/status/1157815349120765954 …
MarkTurpin,Senator Bernie Sanders calls out US President for racism and xenophobia.

ssilverffoxx,Sanders I see you'll never let any event go by that you can't twist to promote your Socialist Communist agenda to destroy America. Who are your donors? https://twitter.com/BernieSanders/status/1158056714391969792 …
CalawayJaneen,re-read the tweet. I wasn't referring to their wealth. I was referring to the fact that they did an independent study that proves Bernie Sanders is right regarding how much Medicare for all will save the American people.
Soleiyu79a,...So tomorrow the right will be hearing that the shooting is more of Sanders’ and Yang’s fault than Trump’s.

MiltonRubenfeld,I would say Bernie Sanders is on the wealthier level. He wrote a very successful book did you know that can make you money?   How did your king of Sweden make his money?

masa_kepic,Bernie Sanders talking about fascist terrorists as if mental health was the main issue.  It’s a global organised strategised ideological movement the terrorists are the tip of the iceberg.

smittie61984,He didn’t shoot 2 peers at Walmart. He tried to slaughter multiple republican congressmen at a softball game practice. He was a Sanders volunteer. He did it because he wanted to stop republicans from voting on the ACA bc Bernie said people would die.

DSnekboi,"Okay- You can sleep..."
KaueBrandon,He was talking about the trauma of experiencing repeated mass shootings in this country and living in fear. Stop blindly reacting to establishment mouthpieces that you damn well know will always post out of context snippets about their enemy Bernie Sanders.
AnxiousBoiVirge,Virgil chuckled a little "Well I might keep it on for the rest of the week if you wish" he notes shrugging a little.
RomanSanders18,Okay but like-- Would yall buy my bathwater if I put it on sale??

f89bfc1c1aa0417,Aside from how anectodal and wrong that is it's actually a pretty disgusting assertion to make. What kind of racist rhetoric does Trump espouse? How is it anti-immigrant? Anti illegal immigrant for sure. Drop out Sanders.
Sadie_Sxnders,@Phobia_Sanders GOD DAMN IT CURTIS HELP

LuckyBoulevard,@DrJasonJohnson never lets truth get in the way of an opportunity to bash Sanders. Such a sad pathetic character he has become. I feel badly for anyone empty-headed enough to listen to the hate drivel that pours out of his mouth. He's become the likeness of all he would condemn.

jascollins1,One effect of a push for "diversity" is mismatching students w/ colleges they're ill-prepared for.  An '04 study by Richard Sander found that at law schools that admit blacks w/ low GPAs/LSATs after the 1st yr 51% were in the bottom 10% of their class compared w/ 5% of whites.
marx_attacks_,I mean it's what Bernie Sanders is running on. But all the other Democrats are avowed capitalists who will continue the market-based approach. You don't think there's some value in receiving a larger share of the wealth your labor generates?

THEChunkOTU,She knows the DNC won’t back her as-is. She was a previous Bernie supporter who quit her DNC role after the Brazile/Clinton/Sanders fiasco. Her only way in is with a moderate the DNC is willing to back. It’s actually a logical move.

jbbrwcky1,Typical anti-Sanders post. Factually wrong and mean spirited.
paganosb13,As you also said on your program if you are to blame Trump for this. You must blame Bernie Sanders and Rachel Maddow for the baseball field shooting that was against Republicans and almost killed scalise the shooter loved them and praise them
Amy_M_Ryan,If you are surprised by Bernie Sanders’ stance on white dudes and gun control then you haven’t been paying attention.
sandersn489,Do you honestly think that you could only be at fault if you openly encouraged mass shooting? That's just ridiculous. Spreading propoganda about a secret plot to destroy the white race that goes on to inspire mass killer absolutely puts one at fault.
sanders_legend,"Good" he took off his pants and entered Dee slowly
JamesGasber,Also if they're exactly the same why not vote for the more experienced and accomplished Sanders? You too must perceive differences and have reasons to favor her.

Sadie_Sxnders,Yeah I’ll try not to rip anyone’s heart out again
usa3000rustic,One could just as easily cherry pick other votes that explain his D- grade.   The problem I see which is why I brought up Howard Dean is that you’re in Washington DC not Vermont. Vermont is a rural state where gun ownership is popular and Sanders serves his constituents.

ginnybeesly,If a far-left terrorist used the exact same wording in his manifesto as Sanders uses at the podium you would be snarking to your heart’s content - or at the least calling for a direct apology from Sanders.   Like it or not the obvious echoes of mainstream rhetoric are relevant.

BentleytheDog,And #Sanders has definitely been more squishy about this. Saying that the military should be used as a "last resort" is something he #Trump #Obama #Bush and #Clinton have all said. And look where we are.
carsonpoltorack,Because willingness or ability to pay doesn’t change how much your vote counts in this country? Yes there’s a lot more energy around Sanders’ campaign among his supporters but thats still less than a fifth of US Dems. This in no way implies he’d beat Trump.

RomanSanders19,He muttered something. It was quiet but not quiet enough. “Make them stop....” He didn’t think Logan would hear. He hoped he wouldn’t.
drogon_dracarys,The context of this clip is also hours before we even knew the identity of the shooter. If you watch Booker Beto Buttigieg who all went before Sanders they also don't address white supremacy bc it wasn't known then.
Zimmlaw175,@SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer  Are you willing to sit back and permit the radical elements of your party drive American Jews out of the party?  I'm talking about Ilhan Omar Rashida Tliab Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and yes Bernie Sanders. Do you want to emulate the Labour party?

MarzG7,So #BernieSanders says he was too busy to effectively run his campaign and prevent systemic misogyny and sexual harassment. I’m sure as President he’d be less busy and therefore perfectly capable of addressing misogyny. https://twitter.com/joshtpm/status/1080642684216397824 …

pebblestrong,this #BernieSanders push to be the #democratic nominee is getting out of hand: he's fake and an opportunitist. his platform is the "working-class" which he has separated from racial oppression and inequalities...AS IF there's no intersectionality.  HE SUCKS!
AndyBIue,Who cares.  #BernieSanders is a big part of why we are in the mess we are in now.  He will spoil the next election too if given the chance.

elmuylorenzo,Joe #Biden as an experienced centrist. #berniesanders is unlikely to gain adequate support in a presidential contest. He doesn't have strong minority backing his policies are not seen as being fiscally sound he is viewed as weak on national defense & is seen as tempermental.
elmuylorenzo,#berniesanders should be a strong progressive voice in the run-up to the 2018 #MidtermElections but he should remove himself from consideration as a prospective Democrat candidate in the 2020 presidential elections. When the time comes he should urge his movement to support
elmuylorenzo,#BernieSanders should allow Joe #Biden to emerge as the principal spokesman for #Democrats moderate #Republicans & #independents like him in the run-up to the 2018 #MidtermElections. He should also allow #Biden to emerge as the prospective #Democrat nominee in the 2020 president
