Pennsylvania,ogreaggressive5,So which is it Sanders are you soullessly using the victims of a tragedy’s suffering to smack Trump a day after a tragedy or are responsible for one of your staff members attempting to and nearly succeeding in slaughtering your Republican colleagues?
Washington,pudgenet,Sanders is a cause. Obama was a cause. He said Republicans wanted poor people to not have health care. He lied. People believed him and hated Republicans for it. But you only seem to mind when it’s someone you generally dislike or disagree with spreading that hate.
Wisconsin,Frankohh,I own a firearm precisely because my family is the most important thing in my life and their protection is my God-mandated duty.
Oregon,TrumpMuv2Russia,Yes Peter Smith supported a ban on assault weapons which Bernie opposed so the NRA sent an urgent letter from Wayne LaPierre to its members in Vermont just before the election urging them to support Bernie. It was a big help to Sanders that got him over the finish line.

Washington,StickandBrains,I know where my state(WA) is gonna go and I'm not at all worried about Sanders in the general.  What worries me are the moderate liberals of the Dem party who think we need an incremental candidate when the vast majority of independents are itching for major change.

Texas,Wra12Cjwr1,Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama also had a majority Dem Congress and did nothing to address gun control.  (I've voted Dem since 1980--until 2016 when I voted 3rd party.)  ONLY Senator Bernard Sanders beats Trump.  Please endorse him.
Washington,JohnsBass007,Rasmussen polls which generally favor rump have Sanders +1 point over him as of Friday.  The voter fractioning between the Biden Warren & Bernie due to their convoluted platforms needs to end there's no focus. People only see a couple of things they want from each candidate.

Wisconsin,Jack_W002,Your argument would be stronger if Sanders won the popular vote not lose it by 12 points.
Colorado,dmbdmg,Some on the right including Kellyanne and Sarah Sanders are using the terrorist term. It may be hard for Trump to go there on white nationalism for same reasons he can’t admit Russia interfered in the election. He’s more worried about how it looks for him than what’s best for US.
New Mexico,JimDines2,They’re not asssult weapons idiot. If they were machine guns they and the owners would all be taxed and tracked. You know that.Thinking westerners will give up weapons to be bullied by drug cartels or the Bernie Sanders version of the KGB you’d be wrong @POTUS @dcexaminer @WSJ

Pennsylvania,rescott534,Really? You see Bernie Sanders doesn’t want to alienate the trump voters because they’re like his voters and he thinks he can take them from trump in 2020 if he’s the nominee. But he won’t be exactly because of this BS. Again Bernie is a dangerous saboteur and hypocrite.

Washington,Marthas4Pete,And Sen. Sanders has never advocated or ignored threats of violence.  Has not declared groups of people "vermin" who've "infested" & "invaded" our country and need to be gotten rid of. He's never suggested using "second amendment rights" to settle questions. Do you know who has?
New York,MaryPatRyan,And yet Sanders takes NO responsibility when HIS supporters are violent.

Washington,dnahealthnut,Everything about Bernie Sanders is a fraud.

Virginia,KeepItRealist,So this dude supported all of Bernie Sanders's and AOC's political positions in his manifesto but this is being ignored in favor of blaming Trump because he specifically said he knew the media would blame Trump and that is fake news?

Texas,amfhTX,I see you have unfollowed me. Sorry to see you go. (no that is NOT snark). We all have reasons to support or not support candidates.  This issue is one why I don't support Warren.  Another is that she agreed w/Sanders that DNC "fixed" things for HRC.  #NeverBernie nor his buds.

Washington,GayMcMillen,Currently Bernie Sanders is a registered Democrat but he's also registered as an Independent for 2024 when he'll run for the Senate if not elected President.

Texas,Fukn_Martinn,There is I just think you’re a little boggled by actually reading a stat for once. But this is coming from a Warren Sanders Beto worshiper who think socialism works. Because 1. You avoided proving that I’m a contrary. And 2. can’t point to a Ben Shapiro stat that has no point.

California,icaito,The Sanders campaign (and ALL Democratic campaigns) should forcefully engage and commit to flipping this Senate seat.   Texas is flippable in 2020 but it needs a serious investment of everyone’s resources.

Nevada,RealEricScottG,While we're pointing fingers at dirty games I do believe it was a Sanders team member that was arrested the day of the County Convention after sending an email to all the HRC delegates saying they didn't need to attend the Clark County Caucus in person.

Georgia,jcsbimp,Also remember whom that fine Senator endorsed once she won to become the Democrat candidate. Would the devoted Sanders followers who stayed home for the General Election had shown the same character and practical sense. Practical sense does not always leave a sweet taste.
Washington,DouglassPatti,Sanders you are a fool with no brains.  If you get to be president we all are in trouble big trouble
California,sanderness,Does anyone in fe3h ever acknowledge the fact that you just recruited every character in the fucking church and every other class is just the class heads? And they dont even have their professors either? Like wtf lol

Nevada,astro_knot78,For starters Tad Devine worked on John Kerry’s and Al Gores campaigns. I’m not sure what you’re suggesting. Second every time Russian sanctions comes to a vote it’s tied to something else like ending the Iran nuclear deal Sanders has spoken about these votes. Quit with the BS.
Ohio,BeTheBern,Wow Neil one of these require intent the others are random accidents.
Michigan,councilof9,Trying to smear half the country over the actions of a deranged individual is beyond despicable.  Whatever respect I had for Sanders is now gone. Pathetic.

New York,JayJay5077,Exactly Pete Warren and Sanders knowns this they don’t have no appeal with POC the only way they will be competitive in SC and other southern states if they knock out Kamala and Biden out early meaning KH and JB will have dropout early or campaign severely damage.

California,01wise,The bill passed 283-144 so I hardly think Sanders vote ranks among the worst. Many people at that time felt that gun control was a hopeless cause sapping support for other left priorities. I have no doubt Bernie will be as tough on guns as anybody while protecting civil rights.

California,dpkronmiller,The video is edited. Full clip above. The Hill is just trying to make money off of this tragedy by creating a clickbait edited clip. At end of video Sanders calls for gun regulations. And the video was made prior to the motive being known. He's made many statements since.
Tennessee,fondaconley14,The search was for Bernie Sanders
New York,KingOfStoops,I wouldn’t say it’s irrelevant.  Mass shooting needs to be redefined it makes America look so bad. But we’re in a very weird time when 50% of the living population in America take some weird pride in saying how bad America is. Everything’s all fucked up idk how it gets fixed
California,ksand87,Sadly this isn’t it y’all. There are more of them cooking up their plans to attack and kill more POC. Be just as or even more vigilant of them as they are of us!

Massachusetts,nerdygrrl,Bernie Sanders making a very loud case for why he is not fit to lead this country. This is so far from reality. These shootings are not the result of mental illness.

Nevada,astro_knot78,Met Bernie Sanders campaign manager at a rally in Seattle 2016. He was walking through Safeco field like everyone else. 
Kansas,SirJacobDale,He was great to have a beer with. I am ashamed to admit some cops are harsh but some care a lot. I'm sure many will understand if you find it hard to trust them and some will blame you for it but not all of them. I know about police brutality but that's why I don't go out much.
Ohio,Phillip06385420,How about a light saber or a phaser.
Colorado,MustoeLora,Sanders is an idiot. Jumps in and out of the Democratic Party. & those that follow his lead will be the demise of the Democratic Party.  He can raise his arms up and down as if he's in the wave but he will never get our vote. Seriously why does the Democratic party tolerate him?
Ohio,Virgil_Is_Upset,He follows Patton
Missouri,kubethy,Go tell that to your boss!!!
Indiana,ekatebi,Bernie Sanders didn't go to rallies to incite violence as trump does.
Georgia,embryglobal,You are correct. The El Paso murder was a progressive meadhead like Rob Reiner & Bernie Sanders - it's the politics of encouragement of violence as political speech that encourage this left-wing crazy to go on a mass-murder rampage. Details coming out...
Massachusetts,billjanovitz,This seems like a very Republican rhetorical question the kind that gets asked every time someone responds to their empty gestures in the context of inaction or in Sanders' case -- active blocking. Holding up a politician's record is not "bashing."
Alabama,RaySand11102604,For a supposedly intelligent individual you have asked a very stupid question.  Try it and see! You’ll go down in history as the person that started the 2nd Civil War in the United States.

New York,KTKeith,You’re trying to guilt people into voting for Sanders because his supporters refuse to vote for anyone else when he loses. We have to vote for Sanders or it will lead to Trump but they don’t have to vote for anyone else knowing it will lead to Trump? It’s obvious who’s the child.

Alabama,RaySand11102604,I somewhat agree that Trump could be more proactive in some areas to help stop this madness. However “infestation” “invasion” and “shithole countries” are pretty accurate though not not my choice of words. Those adjectives do describe real issues.
Florida,Jack66928188,This does not support the claim that Bernie literally told foreigners to come to America for the purpose of obtaining healthcare.  In fact nothing you're saying supports that claim and it's clear to me now that Sanders didn't say this and that you DEFINITELY can't find a source
North Carolina,youlickboots,it’s almost like you’re more interested in getting a jab in than solving the issue. sanders is vocal about fighting white supremacy and gun control.

Virginia,GR365patriot,Sanders? Who’s follower shot Steve Scalise? Bernie the Fraud!
Arizona,ParivashSanders,Expectations how to pre-chart. When to ask a senior to look at your pt or a lab or study. How to call the RN and be a team player. What stat timed routine labs really mean. When cafeteria closes. How to do a great one liner. And my favorite How to think through 1/2

Minnesota,EricJafMN,The NRA was angry at the Republican Congressman.  They sent out a last minute flyer for Bernie Sanders without his permission.  The NRA figured another Republican would be elected in two years.  Bernie won by 16.5% points and so he probably would have won without that flyer.

Nebraska,Jeff4Amer2020,@ChrisJansing @MSNBC did you seriously just cut away from an interview with @AndrewYang to a broadcast a Bernie Sanders rally? That was horrible & very unprofessional. Pathetic!

New York,NYforSanders,We already passed an AW ban in the 1990s and it worked well.  Unfortunately the bill expired.   That’s why Bernie and others are calling for it to be signed back into law.

Texas,IllWillTX,He won’t be either cut or traded but we can not force a player to show up and play for us if they don’t want to. See Barry Sanders.
Louisiana,djinn_the,I would say this about Sanders but not Warren. She sounds like any other neoliberal hawk on foreign policy. Her statements on Israel are disqualifying.   I believe Sanders is more likely to name-names and she is more used to promoting institutional culture.

Ohio,SusieTh08071046,Well in their dictionary they think you can look up white male and the definition would be white supremacy. I take nothing that Sanders says as a fact it’s all about trying to win the race so he could bring in socialism and ruin our country.
Washington,heatherhunterdc,Sanders when asked if he thinks the Senate would vote to regulate semi-automatic weapons the way machine guns are regulated: “So what we need to do is to sit down together and determine for a start clearly I think no more sale and distribution of assault weapons”

Georgia,wcsanders,It's certainly a problem from an accounting perspective that I don't have a good answer to. If you're getting a RADV adjustment by matching principle the costs/income was associated with 2017 but can't be used in MLR until 2021 but GAAP/SAP surely require them to be expensed now

Texas,JohnBWellsCTM,Bernout Sanders sez majority of @realDonaldTrump supporters mentally ill.  SA playbook.  They want the guns. Path to overthrow.  CF 20 mil to SD.  Which means ANTIFA. Follow the data.  Find the $.  Then follow the $. See the future.  #MAGA2020 #DomesticTerrorism

Georgia,wcsanders,I work for an issuer with only 40000 lives total that just went through a new claims system implementation so I'm not unfamiliar with the problems or costs. But you're still leaving money on the table - you're not transferring new costs to other issuers just delaying them.

California,DixieS1943,It is Trump’s character to use his presidency to restrict the news that looks bad about him. Look for the evidence of these races shooters to be hampered from showing their racism.
California,DixieS1943,The Texas Governor Greg Abbott is a republican. He said he would do everything he could to stop this sort of thing and said we should pray for the victims. This seems to be the Republican response. Yet they will do nothing on reasonable gun control or condemn Trumps racism.https://twitter.com/OMGno2trump/status/1158050645632585730 …

North Carolina,rokbrowns,By Sanders definition he is a white supremacist because he is white and thinks he is right. Secondly he would also be considered a Communist sympathizer by his own rule.

Utah,camp_bean,Sanders is an out-and-out red communist. What a junk graph.

California,jholtham,It's the millions of Americans right now saying to themselves and each other Well they did kind of have it coming didn't they? It's the people who vote for GOP politicians. It's the people Sanders is even afraid of pissing off by calling out "gun culture."
Texas,Xzamilloh,No you just chose to miss the point entirely. We can point to Ben Shapiro's words and rhetoric being the inspiration for more than one mass shooter. And yet the ONE example you have a Bernie Sanders supporter was a one off that you CAN'T point to any Bernie Sanders rhetoric

New Jersey,GayderVincent,Btw Bernie Sanders had for decades fought for gun control and to outlaw assault rifles. In a democracy a single senator has little voice in the Senate and no power. He cares and wants progress but he is powerless to do anything. The majority of senate wants guns and violence.

New Jersey,MichaelAllers,Sanders is rankled 77th in terms of wealth among senators despite serving for four decades. So your argument is nonsense. Writing a bestselling book is not exclusive to politicians. Yang has a higher net worth than Sanders does despite being in his 40's why is he not a 1%'er?

New York,cbinaiea,Boycott Giffords Courage.  Any group that wants to ban or limit our Constitutional rights shouldn't be allowed to operate in America.  Bernie Sanders is a Socialist.

Texas,alejandraofHSL,It was a diplomacy trip w/10 guests but that’s real cute how you want to make your followers believe Sanders has a close relationship with Soviet Union but didn’t get the benefits like Trump.  Also your daddy got in a hunting accident or did he mean to shoot Harry Wittinington?

Vermont,BernieSandersE,Sr. Presidente: detenga su retórica racista odiosa y antiinmigrante.  Su idioma crea un clima que envalentona a los extremistas violentos.
California,JamilSmith,Yes I saw the part where Sanders called for gun legislation and—rather quixotically I thought—expressed hope that Trump would sign it. But even bringing up mental health amidst mass shootings is unhelpful and unproductive. And did he mention white nationalism? Honest question.
Texas,a_for2day,Bernie Sanders is an NRA shill. With his mental illness bullshit hes right in line with the likes of Rick Santorum. This is entirely disqualifying https://twitter.com/thehill/status/1157815349120765954 …
Iowa,communistbase,That helps. Spending literally any money at all on a candidate worse than Sanders would just be madness.
Missouri,NoFascistLies,#TrollAlert -- OK with DNC cheating. The reason Bernie Sanders lost by 4 million votes is because people saw the result as a foregone conclusion because Hillary Clinton locked up hundreds of superdelegates before a single vote was cast. https://twitter.com/liruian/status/1158057247500623873 …
Washington,PaulERondeau,Then he didn't do a very good job.    Cummings himself called his community drug infested with people walking around like zombies. The mayor said you could smell the dead rats.  Bernie Sanders called it a 3rd world country.  Only Dems mentioned race.

Kansas,SirJacobDale,I agree. Racist and sexist people are hurtful and the anti-LGBTQ thing is disgusting and caused so much hate and destroyed our sanity. Discrimination is never ok.

Nevada,News3LV,Bernie Sanders came to a packed ballroom at The Center Las Vegas’ organization that supports the LGBTQ community to deliver his populist stem-winder on how he’d make the economy fairer for the middle class http://bit.ly/2KsCn0c

Oregon,jbbrwcky1,Typical anti-Sanders post. Factually wrong and mean spirited.
California,Amy_M_Ryan,If you are surprised by Bernie Sanders’ stance on white dudes and gun control then you haven’t been paying attention.
Ohio,sandersn489,Do you honestly think that you could only be at fault if you openly encouraged mass shooting? That's just ridiculous. Spreading propoganda about a secret plot to destroy the white race that goes on to inspire mass killer absolutely puts one at fault.
Illinois,JamesGasber,Also if they're exactly the same why not vote for the more experienced and accomplished Sanders? You too must perceive differences and have reasons to favor her.
Utah,MrBookNarrator,Sanders cut short his graduate studies to return home to help his mother run the farm but his student deferment had run out and Uncle Sam came calling. #CallMeDeaconBlue #JamesRobersonNovels #Listen #Narration See more: http://bit.ly/DeaconBlue pic.twitter.com/NlmvwrAlpw

North Carolina,AnchorsLife,Stfu Pocahontas..  What about in 2017 when a Bernie Sanders supporter shot Republicans on a  congressional baseball team???  You didn't blame Bernie Sanders...  Trump 2020
Alabama,RaySand11102604,Care to comment on a sitting elected Congresswomen making a statement of ‘take him out’?  As for ‘invasion’ what other term would YOU use?  Thousands of ILLEGAL people coming into a country. Seems sort of appropriate.
New York,usa3000rustic,One could just as easily cherry pick other votes that explain his D- grade.   The problem I see which is why I brought up Howard Dean is that you’re in Washington DC not Vermont. Vermont is a rural state where gun ownership is popular and Sanders serves his constituents.
New York,The_News_DIVA,Sanders says McConnell should call Senate into session for gun safety bill https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/456101-sanders-says-mcconnell-should-call-senate-into-session-for-gun-safety-bill …

Texas,Orozco4Congress,We agree with Sen. Sanders.  We need to pass an emergency bill to curb domestic terrorism and gun violence and it needs to be done NOW.

Maryland,raguillem,I don't like the argument if we could only cut this government program here we could increase that program. We should be talking eliminating the DoE and retiring the debt. I know Massie is mocking Sanders' hypocritical pandering for the teacher union vote.
Missouri,kubethy,Mass shootings are becoming so frequent in America people are going to start fleeing to seek asylum in a safer country! #massshootings #GunControlNow
Ohio,ginnybeesly,If a far-left terrorist used the exact same wording in his manifesto as Sanders uses at the podium you would be snarking to your heart’s content - or at the least calling for a direct apology from Sanders.   Like it or not the obvious echoes of mainstream rhetoric are relevant.
Michigan,AllieSanders,Thanks! I actually have the wellgate ones I wear at night and it helps a lot. But I could definitely use some daytime support especially for my mouse-hand & carrying around the 25lb chunk baby. The splint makes it difficult.

Illinois,JamesGasber,Look I don't have an irrational hatred of Tulsi. She's solid some important issues problematic on others. But if we're going to be serious about addressing fundamental issues of power in society we're gonna need a movement. Sanders has the tools and exp. Gabbard does not.

Texas,consptheory77,I suspect Sanders cares about Baltimore in that abstract socialist sense but do you think Trump really cares about a city that’ll never vote for him?

Maine,THEsandersMMA,You stand with the @NRA and their money. #MoscowMich
Nevada,Sakhrlv,I was canvassing this week for Bernie Sanders and a voter told me he won’t vote for him because he’s giving healthcare to undocumented immigrants.  CNN is responsible for framing this with a right wing perspective.
New York,activist360,So I just happened upon some supporters of Bernie Sanders who are arguing that it was Obama who didn't do enough to stop #WhiteSupremacistTerrorism. Un-f*cking-believable.

Ohio,TieDyedGuy,whether they're Republicans Democrats or independents" Sanders said at a 2020 campaign event in Las Vegas. "And I would hope very much that we can overcome the fear of the NRA and do what the American people want."  Which is his normal message.
New York,EmirSejdik,This has 0 to do with the Brady bill. We have been trying for gun legislation for a decade now but Republicans and some democrats have been agaunst it. Not Sanders. 1993 has no impact on this.
Georgia,wcsanders,So you’re correct it’s all the “other health” in the grand total. So it does include everything in the “other health” so perhaps it’s a bit unfair to group them together.

South Carolina,JCJ417,#BernieSanders  should be the Dem Pres nominee. He is better than any Dem! He is an  INDEPENDENT Senator who caucuses with the Dems.

South Carolina,JCJ417,It would be very interesting to compare the income of everyone who supports #BernieSanders to those "Dems" who vehemently oppose him. My guess is that Bernie's supporters are in general the more poor & disenfranchised group. That is why I am & will always be #StillSanders.

New York,MeinDonaldRump,At this point I agree #BernieSanders is a non-factor but I think progressives understand his impact helped many of them win primaries to begin changing #DemParty. I actually would embrace return to normalcy with #Kerry in particular to stand as sane alternative to #Trump.
New York,MeinDonaldRump,I'll be honest. I voted for #BernieSanders in NY primary. I felt #HRC had too much baggage to appeal to majority. In presidential election of course I voted for #HRC vs idiot #Trump. But she disappointed failing to campaign in #Michigan & #Wisconsin & blowing #Pa & #Ohio.

Texas,STPacker915,Hey  @JoeTalkShow  the #BernieSanders "guaranteed jobs" plan sounds remarkably similar to the plot of The Hunger Games  doesn't it?  12 districts and the government controlling jobs. The only thing missing is games and the tributes from each district.
